# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a TypeScript-based backend service called "fridgeezy-backend" that uses the OpenAI Agents SDK to create an AI agent that interacts with a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for recipe generation. The agent uses a locally hosted MCP server at `http://localhost:8000` to generate recipes based on ingredients.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build the TypeScript project
npm run build

# The compiled output goes to the dist/ directory
```

## Architecture

### Core Dependencies
- `@openai/agents` (actually `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` in package.json): Agent framework
- `openai`: OpenAI API client
- `zod`: Schema validation

### Project Structure
- **src/index.ts**: Main entry point containing the agent configuration and recipe generation logic
- **dist/**: Compiled JavaScript output (generated by TypeScript compiler)

### Agent Configuration
The main agent (`Recipe Assistant`) is configured to:
- Use the `hostedMcpTool` with server label "recipe-generator-mcp"
- Connect to a local MCP server at `http://localhost:8000`
- Execute recipe generation through the `recipe/generate` tool

The current implementation expects an MCP server to be running locally on port 8000 before the agent can function properly.

### TypeScript Configuration
- Target: ES2016
- Module system: CommonJS
- Strict mode enabled
- Output directory: `dist/`
