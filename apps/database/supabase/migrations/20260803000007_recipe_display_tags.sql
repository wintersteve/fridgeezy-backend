-- One source of truth for the tags a recipe SHOWS, so the chips can no longer
-- disagree with the filter.
--
-- THE CONTRADICTION
-- Since 20260803000004 a dietary filter answers from the ingredients
-- (`recipe_dietary`), but every display path still read the model-assigned rows
-- in `recipe_tags`. A recipe the model called vegan therefore rendered a "Vegan"
-- chip while being correctly absent from the vegan filter — the app asserting
-- something the database had already decided was false.
--
-- THE RULE
-- A dietary tag that CAN be derived is shown only when it is derived. Everything
-- else — cuisine, course, component, and the dietary tags no ingredient list can
-- settle (halal, kosher, keto and the other quantitative ones) — is shown as
-- tagged. So the chips and the filter now read the same two sources in the same
-- proportions, and cannot drift.
